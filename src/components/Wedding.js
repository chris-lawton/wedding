    <h2>Attire</h2>
    <p>Tropcial vibes encouraged! ðŸŒ´</p>

    <h2>Bar</h2>
    <p>Something about the bar here</p>

    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>We are so happy that youâ€™ll be able to join us for our wedding. As many of you know, we live in a house in Bristol and it is already filled with all the things we could ever need to make it a home.</p>
    <p>While the presence of your company is the only gift we could ever ask for, if you'd like to make a donation towards our honeymoon then maybe we'll be able to travel to somewhere further than Eastbourne.</p>
